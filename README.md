## Important
Before starting a game a world require:
  - A complete world scan for reloading the map after the game
  - At least 1 spawnpoint created using the spawnwand

This plugin was made in 1.8.9 and I have no idea if it work in newer version of the game as I didn't tested

## Commands
`/start <worldName>` Start the game\
`/end` End the game\
`/scan <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>` Scan and save the map\
`/reloadworld <worldName>` Reload the map (scan must be done first)\
`/spawnwand` Give you the magic tool used to create spawnpoints\
`/loadspawn <worldName>` load a world spawnpoint

All commands require the permission `firebalst.admin`
